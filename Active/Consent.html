            <p class="consent-header">Study Title:</p>
            <p>Perception of Race-Related Stimuli</p>
            <p class="consent-header">Person(s) conducting the research:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">Brian Odegaard, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology
                Email: bodegaard@ufl.edu
                Phone: 651-491-5897
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Purpose of the research study:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">The primary purpose of this study is to examine how quickly and accurately you can respond to
                different race-related and non-race-related stimuli, and to assess your personal opinions about race.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">What you will be asked to do in the study: </p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">If you agree to be in the study, we will ask you to do the following things: (1) sit in front of your computer,
                (2) judge the skin tone of facial stimuli for people of different races, (3) perform timed tests of how you respond to words and photos of
                individuals of difference races, (4) answer a few questions about your general opinions of different races.  
                All responses in this experiment will be completely anonymous, and this experiment will be conducted entirely online.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Time required:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">One session, which can last up to 60 Minutes</p>
            <p class="consent-header">Risks and benefits:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">There are no known risks associated with your participation in this study. The risk to participants
                would not exceed anything that a participant may experience in everyday life. Very similar
                studies have been conducted by the principal investigator, Dr. Brian Odegaard and there have never been
                any reported instances of discomfort. There are no direct benefits of participation to you, but you will be
                contributing to scientific knowledge about how visual information is encoded and remembered.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Confidentiality:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">Your identity will be kept confidential to the extent provided by law. Your information will be assigned a
                code number, and your name will not be attached to your data in any way, thus ensuring that your
                responses will be completely anonymous.  Your name will not be used in any report.  We may collect your 
                SONA URL for completing this task to grant you credit for participating in this study.

                Only the researchers will have access to the information we collect online. There is a minimal risk that
                security of any online data may be breached, but since no identifying information will be collected, and
                 it is unlikely that a security breach of the online data will result in any adverse consequence for you.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Compensation & Withdrawal Policy:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">Participants who will be participating in this study through SONA as
                part of the participation pool will receive 2 course credits for the 60 minute study.  You are
                free to stop participating at any time, but you will only receive credit upon completion.
            </p>
